Welcome to the **Fashion Recommender App**, a platform that helps you discover similar fashion styles based on an image you upload. This app uses advanced machine learning techniques like **ResNet50** for feature extraction and **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** for fashion item similarity matching.

## Features

- **Upload a Fashion Image**: Choose a fashion image to find similar styles.
- **Find Similar Styles**: Get the top 5 fashion items that are similar to your uploaded image.
- **Powered by AI**: Utilizes **ResNet50** and **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** for accurate recommendations.
- **Simple and User-Friendly**: Just upload your image, and the app does the rest!

## How It Works

1. **Upload an Image**: Select an image of a fashion item (like a dress, shirt, or accessory).
2. **Processing**: The app preprocesses your image and extracts features using the **ResNet50** model.
3. **Recommendation**: The app then uses **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** to find the 5 most similar fashion items from a precomputed database of fashion images.
4. **Results**: Youâ€™ll see the top 5 recommended fashion items displayed as images.

## Tech Stack

- **Streamlit**: For building the web application.
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: For loading the pre-trained **ResNet50** model to extract image features.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** algorithm for similarity matching.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and manipulation.
- **HuggingFace Hub**: For storing and loading precomputed fashion embeddings.
